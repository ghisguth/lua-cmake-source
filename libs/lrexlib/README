Lrexlib is a regular expression library for Lua 5.1. The makefiles
provided build it into shared libraries called rex_posix.so and
rex_pcre.so, which can be used with require or loadlib.

Lrexlib is copyright Reuben Thomas 2000-2008 and copyright Shmuel
Zeigerman 2004-2008, and is released under the MIT license, like Lua
(see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html for the full license; it's
basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions to the maintainer, or use the
LuaForge trackers and mailing lists.

Thanks to Thatcher Ulrich for bug and warning fixes, and to Nick
Gammon for adding support for PCRE named subpatterns.
